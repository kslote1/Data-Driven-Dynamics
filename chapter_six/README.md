# Chapter 6

## Introduction

Chapter 6 covers the concepts of deep learning. It goes up to autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS).
Since these are the building blocks for transforms, the models that power large language models, we will try to expand on the
material to include developments here.
